# Memory Check using Valgrind

Valgrind is a memory mismanagement detector. It shows you memory leaks, deallocation errors, etc. Actually, Valgrind is a wrapper around a collection of tools that do many other things (e.g., cache profiling); however, here we focus on the default tool, memcheck.

### Usage:

```
valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes --verbose <executable>
```

## Server with and without memory leaks

Test server present [here](./test_server_with_leaks.c) is present with memory leaks at two places. Its equivalent server free of memory leaks is [here](../test_server.c).

Try to run valgrind on this server and see if it detects any memory leaks.

It should detect two major memory leaks - one would be due to the malloc() call (memory not freed) and the other would be due to pthread_create() call (thread stack not cleaned up).  
Both are easily - first by using free() call to free the memory allocated by malloc() and second by using pthread_join() call to wait for the thread to finish or pthread_detach() to detach the thread after exiting.

Following is the comparison of the two servers when run against a load generator with only 100 users for 1 minute:

- Server with memory leaks (`./test_server_with_leaks.c`):

  - Start of the run: ![Server with memory leaks at Start](./with_leaks_start.png)
  - End of the run: ![Server with memory leaks at End](./with_leaks_end.png)

- Server without memory leaks (`../test_server.c`):
  - Start of the run: ![Server without memory leaks at Start](./without_leaks_start.png)
  - End of the run: ![Server without memory leaks at End](./without_leaks_end.png)
